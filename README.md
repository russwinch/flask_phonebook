## approach
1. started with [Build Simple Restful Api With Python and Flask Part 2](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/build-simple-restful-api-with-python-and-flask-part-2-724ebf04d12)
2. broke code down into __init__ and models
3. fixed bug with the add_contact function not returning json
4. adapted script to purpose the fields needed and regenerated db

## to do
- authentication: http://polyglot.ninja/securing-rest-apis-basic-http-authentication-python-flask/
- implement groups: groups table and link table to assign
- aggregate id column to determine max(id), for testing
- improve error handling
